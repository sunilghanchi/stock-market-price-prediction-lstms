# Stock Market Price Prediction using LSTMs

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and a requirements file for predicting stock market prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

## Contents

- `stock_market_prediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook implementing the LSTM model for stock market price prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries and dependencies required to run the notebook.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sunilghanchi/stock-market-price-prediction-lstms.git
   cd stock-market-price-prediction-lstms
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook stock_market_prediction.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the LSTM model on stock market data.
